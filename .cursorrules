# Cursor Rules for Legal SaaS Dashboard

## Project Overview
This is a Next.js 14 application built with TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. It's a legal SaaS dashboard for managing processes, clients, and finances.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Command Palette**: cmdk

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript
- Always use TypeScript for type safety
- Define proper types and interfaces for all components and functions
- Use type inference where appropriate but be explicit for function parameters and return types
- Prefer `interface` for object shapes, `type` for unions and intersections

### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer `'use client'` directive for client components
- Use meaningful component and variable names
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Keep components focused and single-purpose

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes exclusively
- Follow the existing color palette:
  - Primary orange: `#C96800`
  - Background gray: `#f3f2f2`
  - Border: `#dbdad7`
  - Text dark: `#262626`
  - Text medium: `#666666`
  - Text light: `#878787`
- Use consistent spacing (gap-2, gap-4, py-6, px-4, etc.)
- Maintain responsive design patterns
- Use transition classes for animations (transition-all, transition-colors, transition-opacity)

### Animation & Motion
- Use Figma motion principles
- Prefer dissolve/fade animations (opacity transitions)
- Default timing: 300ms
- Default easing: ease-out
- Use `duration-300 ease-out` for standard transitions

### File Organization
- Keep components in the `app/` directory for Next.js App Router
- Use descriptive file names matching component names
- Group related functionality together

### Code Quality
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Add comments for complex logic or business rules
- Keep functions small and focused
- Avoid deeply nested code structures
- Use early returns for better readability

### Git & Version Control
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Commit related changes together
- Keep commits atomic and focused

## Specific Patterns

### Sidebar Navigation
- Icons should use lucide-react components
- Standard icon size: 20px for main nav, 18px for settings
- Hover effects: background color change + tooltip with opacity transition
- AI Assistente icon uses custom SVG with orange color (#C96800)
- Group navigation items logically with spacing (mt-16 for significant gaps)

### Command Palette
- Use cmdk library
- Implement keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl+K)
- Include value props for search functionality
- Use stopPropagation to prevent backdrop clicks from closing

### Search Functionality
- Implement debouncing for search inputs
- Provide clear empty states
- Use refs for click-outside detection

## Dependencies
- next: 14.0.4
- react: ^18
- typescript: ^5
- tailwindcss: ^3.3.0
- lucide-react: (icons)
- cmdk: (command palette)

## Best Practices
1. Always test responsive behavior
2. Maintain accessibility (aria-labels, semantic HTML)
3. Optimize images using Next.js Image component when possible
4. Use state management appropriately (useState, useEffect)
5. Handle loading and error states
6. Keep bundle size in mind when adding dependencies

## Notes
- The project uses a custom font (Hedvig Letters Serif and Sans)
- Design follows Figma specifications closely
- Color scheme is carefully defined and should be maintained
- Sidebar has a fixed width of 60px
- Header height is 70px
